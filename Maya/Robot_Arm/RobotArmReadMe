Began Work on Robot arm model based on concept sketches. I also remembered my favorite robot arm from Portal 2 and will be working to add details based on that moving forward.

Finished Working on Robot Arm Geo. I found that adding detail to this without losing the feel of the arm to be difficult. I tried extruding different parts of the model but got some strand results.
In the end, I think I was able to add detail by adding and editing shapes here and there and gave the arm a little bit of character in its shape that felt right to me after messing around with different details.
