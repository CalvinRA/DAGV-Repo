These are the three different Robot arm sketches I made.

  The first one is a more traditional industrial arm with even lengthed arm sections. 
  The main rotation joint in the base can move 360 degrees with every other joint bending in one diretion.

  The second sketch is inteded to look weird with rounded shapes and the sizes of the arm parts uneaven to help make an alien look to the arm.
  The joints can all been in multipule directions with no clear way to show how they connet.

  The third arm is focues with having pistons in the sections give the arm the added functionality of addjusting it's own length to suit it's current needs.
  I havn't decided if they pistons pices or allowthe joints to do the rotations of the arm.
